Hi I'm Connor MacKinnon. I'm from Massachusetts, about an hour south of Boston! I'm hoping to major in computer science and I have interest in potentially double majoring in a field where CS applies nicely (open to suggestions!). I love throwing around the football or playing any kind of pick up sports, I love trying new foods and also creating my own hot sauces, and when all else fails tucking into an exciting book. I'm really excited to learn more about data science and I have some previous experience with R (limited albeit).
